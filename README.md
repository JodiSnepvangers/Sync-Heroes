# Sync Heroes
Sync Heroes is a game mode meant for the Overwatch Workshop

in Sync Heroes, players fight in rounds in which they play the exact same hero, and have to fight each other as such. Ultimate charge carries over between rounds!

At the top left of the screen, it will show you a prize for that round. To whoever wins that round will recieve that prize during the next round, which can range from a few bonus points to a buff to make them stronger, but also a bigger target.

## How to play: 
Simply download the text file from the project, and copy its entire content to your clipboard. Open Overwatch, start a custom lobby, and open the settings. You should find a orange button near the top right that lets you import the script into the lobby.
